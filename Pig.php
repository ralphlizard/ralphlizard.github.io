				Pigs in Cambodia (unofficial title) is a collaborative work with <a href="http://maryyann.com">Maryyann Landlord</a> and Professor Andrew Ellis Johnson. It is a 3D environment created through Autodesk Maya and Blender in which a couple of pigs are released to wander in a ruined library, a practice used by Pol Pot's regime.
				</p>
				<p>
				The project was conceived and directed by Professor Johnson, while Maryyann modelled and animated the pigs. All static props were created by me. More updates incoming.
